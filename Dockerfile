# We're using a multi-stage build process to reduce the final image size.
# The builder stage installs all dependencies and builds the Next.js application.
# The runner stage starts with a clean Node.js image and copies only the necessary files
# from the builder stage. This includes the build output, package.json, node_modules, and public assets.

FROM node:18-alpine as builder

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install the application dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js application
RUN npm run build

# Start the second stage
